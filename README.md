## Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard

# Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard

## Overview

The **Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard** is a web application developed for **CABRA**, aimed at enhancing supply chain efficiency through machine learning simulations. The dashboard focuses on improving demand forecasting, optimizing inventory management, and refining route logistics to reduce costs and carbon footprint.

## Features

- **Improve Demand Forecasting**
  - Simulate the use of historical sales data to predict future demand.
  - Utilize models like ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet (simulation only).

- **Optimize Inventory Management**
  - Reduce stockouts and overstock situations.
  - Apply reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms (simulation) to recommend optimal stock levels.

- **Route and Logistics Optimization**
  - Optimize delivery routes to reduce transportation costs and carbon emissions.
  - Use genetic algorithms and heuristics (simulation) for complex routing problems.

- **Interactive Data Visualization**
  - Display data using charts and graphs powered by Chart.js and react-chartjs-2.
  - Include bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for different datasets.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Fully responsive layout for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js, React
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts and Visualization**: Chart.js, react-chartjs-2
- **Map Integration**: Leaflet, React-Leaflet
